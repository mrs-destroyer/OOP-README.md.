# Python OOPs Concepts:
It is a programming approach based an class and object in simpla language. OOP is the method to represent the real world entity in the programming.


# Python3 Intermediate Level Topics:
variables, data types such as strings, integers, floats, lists, tuples, dictionaries, control structures such as if statements, loops, functions, modules, and file handling.


# Class, Object and Members:
# 1.Class_ 
A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class . An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class.
# 2.Object_
Functions, classes, strings, and even types are objects in Python: like any object, they have a type, they can be passed as function arguments, and they may have methods and properties. Therefore, Python is object oriented programming language.
# 3.Members_
A member function is function which present inside the body of a class . It is same as normal function but it can only called by using an object rather a normal function can be called directly.


# Data Hiding and Object Printing:
# 1.Data Hiding_
Data hiding, also called "data encapsulation," keeps the user from seeing how certain parts of a service work. Data hiding groups class members together, making it harder to get direct access to the class members. Data hiding is essential to making an app more safe and reliable.
# 2.Object Printing_
Python print() function is used to print the specified object to the standard output device (screen) or to a text stream file. The Python print() method is used to print a given message to the screen or to display an object's value on the terminal.

# Inheritance, examples of object, issubclass and super:
# 1.Inheritance_
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class. Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
# 2.Example of Object_
We can look around we now and take many examples of real-world objects: your Sofa , your desk, your Laptop and  your bed. These real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior.
# 3.issubclass_
The issubclass() function returns True if the specified object is a subclass of the specified object, otherwise it will returns False.
# 4.superclass_
In Python, the super() keyword is a built-in method that returns a proxy object . It allows us to access methods present in the base class.


# Polymorphism in Python:
Polymorphism is a term used in Python to refer to an object's ability to take on multiple forms. The term is derived from two distinct terms: poly, which means numerous, and morphs, which means forms.


# Class and static variable in python:
# 1.Class variable in python_
Class variables are defined within the class construction. Because they are owned by the class itself, class variables are shared by all instances of the class. They therefore will generally have the same value for every instance unless you are using the class variable to initialize a variable.
# 2.Static variable in python_
When we declare a variable inside a class, but outside the method, it is called a static or class variable. It can be called directly from a class but not through the instances of a class.


# Class method and static method in python:
# 1. Class Method in python_
A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance. It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class.
# 2. Static Method in python_
A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. This method can't access or modify the class state. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.
